## Overview
Adaptive Cards are platform-agnostic snippets of UI, authored in JSON, that apps and services can openly exchange. When delivered to a specific app, the JSON is transformed into native UI that automatically adapts to its surroundings. It helps design and integrate light-weight UI for all major platforms and frameworks.

This plugin enables Adaptive cards for ConverseJS. It does the following:

- Uses https://adaptivecards.io/designer/ for designing adaptive cards and creating card JSON
- Paste JSON into a Converse conversation and render the JSON.
- Data entered into an interactive form will be stored as a PEP using the button name.
