# converse-oauth

This plugin provides OAuth functionality to Converse

## WARNING: This plugin needs to be updated

This pugin used to be in the main Converse library, but has been moved to the
community plugins repo instead.

The code has been copied over, but not tested and will need to be
updated/maintained to get it working again.

### Steps to be done to get it working:

1. Set up a loader/bundler like Rollup to create a new build with index.js, styles.scss and the 3rd party dependency hello.js
2. The `overrides` in the plugin probably don't work no more and need to be removed/refactored.
